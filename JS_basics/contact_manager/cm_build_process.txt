Feature 1: when click on add contact button a form appears that contains:
    > inputs for full name, email, & phone #
    > submit button
    > cancel button
    > also, want to add dropdown option to the form that allows user to
      select a tag

Input Requirements:
example: tested submitting x for fullname, x for phone #, and x for email
 > for emails need to check if there is an '@' in the email and that there is
     >= 1 character after the @ followed by a period & >= 2 more characters
    examples: x       // invalid email
              x@yco   // invalid email
              x@y.co  // valid email
              x@y.c   // invalid email
    <> assuming case insensitive for characters
      <=> regex pattern: /[a-z]{1,}@[a-z]{1,}\.[a-z]{2,}/i
      
 > phone number doesn't have validation (base version allows for
    inputting 'x') - will assume american numbers and add validation
    that checks for ###-###-#### format where # = number 0-9
    <=> regex pattern: /[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}/
 > fullname can't be empty or consist of only spaces

Implementation:
 i. find all buttons with the class btn btn-lg btn-outline
 ii. iterate over the found buttons and search field and add a click event listener
    to each of them
    > if have a lot of click event listeners, will consider implementing
     event delegation, but for now features are minimal, so okay to add event
     listener to each
 iii. upon clicking the buttons/search field:
    > remove the hide class from the form that allows the user to submit
      a fullname, email, phone #, and select a tag
    > hide the add contact buttons and search button
 iv. add event listener to button in the form that allows user to Cancel
    > by cancelling, the form should be rehidden and the add contact button(s),
    and search button should reappear
    > only 1 contact button should reappear if contacts have already been added
