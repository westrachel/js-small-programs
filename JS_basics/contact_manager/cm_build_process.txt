Feature 1: when click on add contact button a form appears that contains:
    > inputs for full name, email, & phone #
    > submit button
    > cancel button

Input Requirements:
example: tested submitting x for fullname, x for phone #, and x for email
 > for emails need to check if there is an '@' in the email and that there is
     >= 1 character after the @ followed by a period & >= 2 more characters
    examples: x       // invalid email
              x@yco   // invalid email
              x@y.co  // valid email
              x@y.c   // invalid email
    <> assuming case insensitive for characters
      <=> regex pattern: /[a-z]{1,}@[a-z]{1,}\.[a-z]{2,}/i
      
 > phone number doesn't have validation (base version allows for
    inputting 'x') - will assume american numbers and add validation
    that checks for ###-###-#### format where # = number 0-9
 > fullname can't be empty or consist of only spaces

Implementation:
 i. find all button(s) with the class btn btn-lg btn-outline
    <> one button will be hidden if there is >= 1 contact entered
 ii. add click event listener to the found buttons
 iii. upon clicking remove the hide class from the form that allows
     the user to submit a fullname, email, and phone #
